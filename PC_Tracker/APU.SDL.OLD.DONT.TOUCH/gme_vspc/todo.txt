Clickable "E:" to mute, now make it "darken" including the colons inverse phase volume, and including volume bars
Look at Voice volume darkening for example.. And try to abstract the code

Migrate to SDL2
  The audio callback does NOT start with a fully initialized buffer anymore.
  (hopefully not  problem )

  SDL_WM_SetCaption is gone,

  SDL_PushEvent() now returns 1 on success instead of 0.

  When calling SDL_SetColorKey(), you should pass SDL_TRUE instead of SDL_SRCCOLORKEY.

  SDLMod is now SDL_Keymod and its "META" keys (the "Windows" keys) are now called the "GUI" keys.

  Strip double click event stuffz

  The first change, simply enough, is that the mousewheel is no longer a button. This was a mistake of history, and we've corrected it in SDL 2.0. Look for SDL_MOUSEWHEEL events. We support both vertical and horizontal wheels, and some platforms can treat two-finger scrolling on a trackpad as wheel input, too. You will no longer receive SDL_BUTTONDOWN events for mouse wheels, and buttons 4 and 5 are real mouse buttons now.



Scrolling text at bottom-right when text is too long to read
